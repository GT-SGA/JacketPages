If you have not done so already, make a local jacketpages_dev sql copy (how-to is on our drive) 
Connect to that database using the MySQL command line client
Then,
run node main.js
Make sure it says "Connected!" in cmd/terminal
Open http://localhost:8081 on your browser

main.js is used for all your routing needs and also serves all the HTML's so make sure you add a get request for your site so its files can be served.
